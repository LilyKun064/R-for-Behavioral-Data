This code is written by Chenkun Jiang for the Garland lab in University of California-Riverside to analysis behavioral data of Forced Swim Experiment, on August 12th, 2024

# cldataBehavior
inspired by 'cldata' from https://github.com/kellyjwallace/cowlogdata

Basic functions include:
  1. calculate the total time spent of a certain behavior
  2. total attempts of showing certain behavior

I modified it to: 
  1. fit our data file pattern
  2. add function to calculate the time of certain behavior in each minute of the whole experiment
  3. remove the parameter 'factor' (add it back if you need it)
